# QD - A C++/Fortran-90 double-double and quad-double package

***Note:*** QD library has written by Yozo Hida, Xiaoye S. Li and David H. Bailey and others in LBNL.  
This repository is ***UNOFFICIAL*** copy of official package to trace history.

##Introduction
This package supports both a double-double datatype (approx. 32 decimal digits) and a quad-double datatype (approx. 64 decimal digits). 
The computational library is written in C++. Both C++ and Fortran-90 high-level language interfaces are provided to permit one 
to use convert an existing C++ or Fortran-90 program to use the library with only minor changes to the source code. 
In most cases only a few type statements and (for Fortran-90 programs) read/write statements need to be changed. 
PSLQ and numerical quadrature programs are included. 

##License
It is 3-clause BSD license with LBNL clause.
